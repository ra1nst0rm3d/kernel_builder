# Info about builder
* For CLegacy kernel and CLegacy branch kernels for begonia
* Script - builder.sh
* Compiller - Proton Clang 13 by kdrag0n
* Zipper - AnyKernel3 by osm0sis
* Auto-Clean function
* Auto-Build function

# How to use
* If you are building the kernel for the first time, then you need to run the script requirements.sh in repo folder as root: <code>./requirements.sh</code> (you only need to do this once).
* You no longer need to download any compilers, AnyKernel and the source code of the kernel itself. My builder script will install all the necessary tools by itself.
* Use builder.sh for compile my kernels
* Use cleanup.sh for remove compilled files and etc.
* The compiled and zipped kernel will appear in the builder folder
