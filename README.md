# Info about builder
* For CLegacy kernel and CLegacy branch kernels for begonia
* Compiller - Proton Clang 13 by kdrag0n
* Zipper - AnyKernel3 by osm0sis

# How to use
* You no longer need to download any compilers, AnyKernel and the source code of the kernel itself. My builder script will install all the necessary tools by itself.
* If you are building the kernel for the first time, then you need to run the script requirements.sh in repo folder as root: <a href=https://github.com/7Soldier/kernel_builder/blob/begonia/requirements.sh>requirements.sh</a> (you only need to do this once).
* Use <a href=https://github.com/7Soldier/kernel_builder/blob/begonia/builder.sh>builder.sh</a> for compile my kernels
* Use <a href https://github.com/7Soldier/kernel_builder/blob/begonia/cleanup.sh>cleanup.sh</a> for remove compilled files and etc.
* The compiled and zipped kernel will appear in the builder folder
